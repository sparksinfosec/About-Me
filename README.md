## Hello!
I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and provide some additional information about me. 
### About me 
I am a passionate technologist. I have recently graduated from Arizona State with a BS in Information Technology (December 2023). I have been working at Square/Weebly for almost six years (January 2023). And I have a passion for networking, information systems, and security. I currently support the Weebly website editor, and Square Online product as a tier 3 Application Support Engineer. However with my degree finished I am looking to transition into more a more technical role and advance towards a security focused career.
