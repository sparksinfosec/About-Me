## Hello!
I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and provide some additional information about me. 
### About me 
I am a passionate technologist. I have recently graduated from Arizona State with a BS in Information Technology (December 2023). I have been working at Square/Weebly for almost six years (January 2023). And I have a passion for networking, information systems, and security. I currently support the Weebly website editor, and Square Online product as a tier 3 Application Support Engineer. However with my degree finished I am looking to transition into more a more technical role and advance towards a security focused career. I got my job at Weebly in order to gain some hands on experience as I started my journey as a Self Taught Programmer. Over the years my interest expanded and changed. Eventually I enrolled in the Information Technology degree program at ASU in Fall of 2019. I quickly fell in love with networking, information security, and information system concepts. There are still aspects of programming and coding that I still enjoy, however I have began to focus on more infrastructure and system engineering concepts and have a genuine passion for all aspects of information security. 

#### Personal 
I was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona and have spend my entire life here. I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kids. As well as film, television, and reading. I have a passion for sports and basketball. Since graduating I have dedicated my extra time and focus to contiuning my education in core concepts including networking, Linux, information security, and programming. I love to contiune to learn and improve my inforamtion technology skills.
